## Self-Evaluation: 
(For this assignment, there was 22 exercises checked by 68 automated checks)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

I ran through and passed all of the unit tests, and I think I deserve 19/20 points. I noticed we used a lot of JavaScript's built in functions to solve problems, but I resorted to some traditional for loops to solve some of the array problems (e.g., filter and sum). Also, I worked around parseInt by using parseFloat and then truncating the numbers after the decimal point. If I was supposed to use built in functions instead of loops or parseFloat, then I'm sorry.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
One thing I noticed was how much easier it is to work with arrays in JavaScript compared to a language like Java. 
I'm used to declaring new arrays and copying the old array in order to add something to the end of one, so using a function like push to achieve the same result is so helpful. Same with removing elements from an array. These functions save a lot of time.

### How long it took you to finish this?
I worked on this on and off for a little over two hours, so I don't really have an accurate measurement.
